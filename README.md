# **_Work Day Scheduler: Challenge #5_**


## **_Objective of the project_**
The work day scheduler - as the name suggests - allows the user to plan their work day based on a 9AM-5PM schedule. Users can enter their daily tasks and leave the page reassured that their notations have been stored in local storage so any changes made to the scheduler will be saved should the user decide to do so.
